Q1. Vertices and edges in graph theory can represent various real-world scenarios. For instance, in social networks, vertices may represent individuals, and edges signify connections or friendships between them. In transportation networks, vertices could represent locations, and edges represent roads or routes connecting them.

Q2. A directed graph has edges with a specific direction, indicating a one-way relationship, while an undirected graph has bidirectional edges. This directional aspect influences data interpretation by reflecting asymmetrical relationships in scenarios like web page links or social media follows.

Q3. Cycles in a graph represent loops where a sequence of edges returns to the starting vertex. Understanding cycles is crucial for detecting dependencies and connections in applications like project scheduling or network routing, helping prevent infinite loops or dependencies.

Q4. Weighted edges assign numerical values to connections, impacting algorithms and analysis. This is vital for scenarios like optimizing routes in a weighted graph representing distances or travel times, providing a more accurate representation of the underlying data.

Q5. Adjacency matrices and lists store graph connectivity information. Matrices are efficient for dense graphs but consume more space, while lists are better for sparse graphs, saving space but potentially requiring more time for certain operations.

Q6. In graph traversal algorithms, DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, while BFS explores level by level. The choice affects understanding: DFS may discover deeper relationships first, while BFS provides a broader overview, impacting applications like network analysis or maze solving.
